One large and rather overlooked sides of writing your own rulesets is how
to debug the rulesets on your own, and how to find where you have done your 
mistakes in the rulesets. This chapter will show you a few basic steps you can
take to debug your scripts and find out what is wrong with them, as well as
some more elaborate things to look for and what can be done to avoid being
unable to connect to your firewall in case you accidentally run a bad ruleset
on it.
    </para>
    
    <para>
Most of what is taught here is based upon the assumption that the ruleset was
written in bash shell scripts, but they should be easy to apply in other
environments as well. Rulesets that have been saved with
<command>iptables-save</command><indexterm><primary>iptables-save</primary>
</indexterm>
are another piece of code alltogether unfortunately, and pretty much none of
these debugging methods will give you much luck. On the other hand,
<command>iptables-save</command> files are much simpler and since they can't
contain any scripting code that will create specific rules either, they are
much simpler to debug as well.
    </para>

      <title id="debugginganecessity.title">Debugging, a necessity</title>
      
      <para>
Debugging is more or less a necessity when it comes to iptables and netfilter 
and most firewalls in general. The problem with 99% of all firewalls is that 
in the end there is a human being that decides upon the policies and how the 
rulesets are created, and I can promise you, it is easy to make a mistake while 
writing your rulesets. Sometimes, these errors are very hard to see with the 
naked eye, or to see the holes that they are creating through the firewall. 
Holes that you don't know of or didn't intend to happen in your scripts can
create havoc on your networks, and create an easy entry for your attackers.
Most of these holes can be found rather easily with a few good tools.
      </para>
      
      <para>
Other than this, you may write bugs into your scripts in other ways as 
well, which can create the problem of being unable to login to the firewall. 
This can also be solved by using a little bit of cleverness before running the 
scripts at all. Using the full power of both the scripting language as well as 
the system environment can prove incredibly powerful, which almost all 
experienced Unix administrators should already have noticed from before, and 
this is basically all we do when debugging our scripts as well.

      </indexterm>
      
      <para>
There are quite a few things that can be done with bash to help debugging your 
scripts containing the rulesets. One of the first problems with finding a bug 
is to know on which line the problem appears. This can be solved in two 
different ways, either using the bash -x flag, or by simply entering some 
<command>echo</command><indexterm><primary>Debugging</primary>
<secondary>Echo</secondary></indexterm><indexterm><primary>Echo</primary>
</indexterm> statements to find the place where the problem happens. 
Ideally, you would, with the <command>echo</command> statement, add something 
like the following echo statement at regular intervals in the code:
      </para>
      
      <screen>
  ...
  echo "Debugging message 1."
  ...
  echo "Debugging message 2."
  ...
      </screen>
      
      <para>
In my case, I generally use pretty much worthless messages, as long as they
have something in them that is unique so I can find the error message by a
simple grep or search in the script file. Now, if the error message shows up
after the "Debugging message 1." message, but before "Debugging message 2.",
then we know that the erroneous line of code is somewhere in between the two
debugging messages. As you can understand, bash has the not really bad, but at
least peculiar, idea of continuing to execute commands even if there is an
error in one of the commands before. In netfilter, this can cause some very
interesting problems for you. The above idea of simply using echo statements
to find the errors is extremely simple, but it is at the same time very nice
since you can narrow the whole problem down to a single line of code and see
what the problem is directly. 
      </para>
      
      <para>
The second possibility to find the above problem is to use the
<command>-x</command><indexterm><primary>Bash</primary><secondary>-x</secondary>
</indexterm> variable to bash, as we spoke of before. This can of course be a
minor problem, especially if your script is large, and if your console buffer
isn't large enough. What the <command>-x</command> variable means is quite
simple, it tells the script to just echo every single line of code in the
script to the standard output of the shell (generally your console). What you
do is to change your normal start line of the script from this:
      </para>
      
      <screen>
#!/bin/bash
      </screen>

      <para>
Into the line below:
      </para>
      
      <screen>
#!/bin/bash -x
      </screen>
      
      <para>
As you will see, this changes your output from perhaps a couple of lines, to 
copious amounts of data on the output. The code shows you every single command 
line that is executed, and with the values of all the variables et cetera, so 
that you don't have to try and figure out exactly what the code is doing. 
Simply put, each line that gets executed is output to your screen as well. One 
thing that may be nice to see, is that all of the lines that bash outputs are 
prefixed by a +<indexterm><primary>Bash</primary><secondary>+-sign</secondary>
</indexterm> sign. This makes it a little bit easier to discern error or 
warning messages from the actual script, rather than just one big mesh of 
output. 
      </para>
      
      <para>
The <command>-x</command> option is also very interesting for debugging a
couple of other rather common problems that you may run into with a little bit
more complex rulesets. The first of them is to find out exactly what happens
with what you thought was a simple loop, such as an for, if or while
statement? For example, let's look at an example.
      </para>
      
      <screen>
  #!/bin/bash 
  iptables="/sbin/iptables"
  $iptables -N output_int_iface
  cat /etc/configs/machines | while read host; do
    $iptables -N output-$host
    $iptables -A output_int_iface -p tcp -d $host -j output-$host

    cat /etc/configs/${host}/ports | while read row2; do
      $iptables -A output-$host -p tcp --dport $row2 -d $host -j ACCEPT
    done
  done
      </screen>
      
      <para>
This set of rules may look simple enough, but we continue to run into a problem 
with it. We get the following error messages that we know come from the above 
code by using the simple echo debugging method.
      </para>
      
      <screen>
work3:~# ./test.sh
Bad argument `output-'
Try `iptables -h' or 'iptables --help' for more information.
cat: /etc/configs//ports: No such file or directory
      </screen>
      
      <para>
So we turn on the <command>-x</command> option to bash and look at the output.
The output is shown below, and as you can see there is something very weird
going on in it. There are a couple of commands where the
<command>$host</command> and <command>$row2</command> variables are replaced
by nothing. Looking closer, we see that it is only the last iteration of code
that causes the trouble. Either we have done a programmatical error, or there
is something strange with the data. In this case, it is a simple error with
the data, which contains a single extra linebreak at the end of the file. This
causes the loop to iterate one last time, which it shouldn't. Simply remove
the trailing linebreak of the file, and the problem is solved. This may not be
a very elegant solution, but for private work it should be enough. Otherwise,
you could add code that looks to see that there is actually some data in the
$host and <command>$row2</command> variables.
      </para>

      <para>
The third and final problem you run into that can be partially solved with the
help of the <command>-x</command> option is if you are executing the firewall
script via
<command>SSH</command>,<indexterm><primary>SSH</primary></indexterm> and the
console<indexterm><primary>console</primary></indexterm> hangs in the middle
of executing the script, and the console simply won't come back, nor are you
able to connect via <command>SSH</command> again. In 99.9% of the cases, this
means there is some kind of problem inside the script with a couple of the
rules. By turning on the <command>-x</command> option, you will see exactly at
which line the script locks dead, hopefully at least. There are a couple of
circumstances where this is not true, unfortunately. For example, what if the
script sets up a rule that blocks incoming traffic, but since the
<command>ssh/telnet</command> server sends the echo first as outgoing traffic,
netfilter will remember the connection, and hence allow the incoming traffic
anyways if you have a rule above that handles connection states.
      </para>
      
      <para>
As you can see, it can become quite complex to debug your ruleset to its full
extent in the end. However, it is not impossible at all. You may also have
noticed, if you have worked remotely on your firewalls via
<command>SSH</command>, for example, that the firewall may hang when you load
bad rulesets. There is one more thing that can be done to save the day in
these circumstances.
<command>Cron</command><indexterm><primary>Cron</primary></indexterm> is an
excellent way of saving your day. For example, say you are working on a
firewall 50 kilometers away, you add some rules, delete some others, and then
delete and insert the new updated ruleset. The firewall locks dead, and you
can't reach it. The only way of fixing this is to go to the firewall's
physical location and fix the problem from there, unless you have taken
precautions<indexterm><primary>precautions</primary></indexterm> that is!

      <para>
One of the best precautions you may take against a locked down firewall is to 
simply use cron to add a script that is run every 5 minutes or so that resets 
the firewall, and then remove that cron line once you are sure the installation 
works fine. The cron line may look something like the one below and be entered 
with the command <command>crontab<indexterm><primary>crontab</primary>
</indexterm> -e</command>.

      <screen>

      <para>
Make absolutely sure, that the line will actually work and do what you expect it
to do before you start doing something you expect will or may freeze the 
server you are working on. 
      </para>
      
      <para>
Another tool that is constantly used to debug your scripts is the syslog
<indexterm><primary>syslog</primary></indexterm> facility. This is the
facility that logs all log-messages created by a ton of different programs. In
fact, almost all large programs support syslog logging, including the kernel.
All messages sent to syslog have two basic variables set to them that are very
important to remember, the facility and the log level/priority.
       </para>
      
      <para>
The facility tells the syslog server from which facility the log entry came 
from, and where to log it. There are several specified facilities, but the one 
in question right now is the Kern facility, or kernel facility as it may also 
be called. All netfilter generated messages are sent using this facility.
      </para>
      
      <para>
The log level tells syslog how high priority the log messages have. There are 
several priorities that can be used, listed below.
      </para>
      
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>err</para><indexterm><primary>syslog</primary>
	  <secondary>err</secondary></indexterm>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>crit</para><indexterm><primary>syslog</primary>
	  <secondary>crit</secondary></indexterm>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>alert</para><indexterm><primary>syslog</primary>
	  <secondary>alert</secondary></indexterm>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>emerg</para><indexterm><primary>syslog</primary>
	  <secondary>emerg</secondary></indexterm>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      
      <para>
Depending on these priorities, we can send them to different log files using 
the syslog.conf. For example, to send all messages from the kern facility with 
warning priority to a file called <filename>/var/log/kernwarnings</filename>,
we could do as shown below. The line should go into the
<filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename>.<indexterm><primary>syslog.conf</primary>
</indexterm>
      </para>
      
      <screen>
kern.warning                       /var/log/kernwarnings
      </screen>
      
      <para>
As you can see, it's quite simple. Now you will hopefully find your netfilter
logs in the file
<filename>/var/log/kernwarnings</filename><indexterm>
<primary>kernwarnings</primary></indexterm> (after restarting, or
<command>HUP</command>'ing the <systemitem>syslog</systemitem>  server). Of
course, this also depends on what log levels you set in your netfilter logging
rules. The log level can be set there with the <command>--log-level</command>
option.
      </para>
      
      <para>
The logs entered into this file will give you information about all the packets 
that you wish to log via specific log rules in the ruleset. With these, you can 
see if there is anything specific that goes wrong. For example, you can set 
logrules in the end of all the chains to see if there are any packets that are 
carried over the boundary of the chains. A log entry may look something like 
the example below, and include quite a lot of information as you can see.
      </para>
      
      <screen>
  Oct 23 17:09:34 localhost kernel: IPT INPUT packet died: IN=eth1 OUT= 
MAC=08:00:09:cd:f2:27:00:20:1a:11:3d:73:08:00 SRC=200.81.8.14 DST=217.215.68.146

      </screen>
      
      <para>
As you can understand, syslog can really help you out when debugging your 
rulesets. Looking at these logs may help you understand why some port that you 
wanted to open doesn't work.

      <para>
Iptables can be rough to debug sometimes, since the error messages from 
iptables itself aren't very user friendly at all times. For this reason, it may 
be a good idea to take a look at the most common error messages you can get 
from iptables, and why you may have gotten them.
      </para>
      
      <para>
One of the first error messages to look at is the "Unknown
arg"<indexterm><primary>Unknown arg</primary></indexterm> error. This may show
up for several reasons. For example, look below.
      </para>
<indexterm><primary>Errors</primary><secondary>Unknown arg</secondary>
</indexterm>
      
      <screen>
work3:~# iptables -A INPUT --dport 67 -j ACCEPT
iptables v1.2.9: Unknown arg `--dport'
Try `iptables -h' or 'iptables --help' for more information.
      </screen>
      
      <para>
This error is simpler than normal to solve, since we have only used a single 
argument. Normally, you may have used a long, long command and get this error 
message. The problem in the above scenario is that we have forgotten to use the 
<command>--protocol</command> match, and because of that, the
<command>--dport</command> match isn't available to us. 
Adding the <command>--protocol</command> match would also solve the problem in
this match. Make absolutely certain that you are not missing any special
preconditions that are required to use a specific match.
      </para>
      
      <para>
Another very common error is if you miss a dash (-) somewhere in the command 
line, like below. The proper solution is to simply add the dash, and the 
command will work.
      </para>
      
      <screen>
work3:~# iptables -A INPUT --protocol tcp -dport 67 -j ACCEPT
Bad argument `67'
Try `iptables -h' or 'iptables --help' for more information.
      </screen>
      
      <para>
And finally, there is the simple misspelling, which is rather common as well. 
This is shown below. The error message, as you will notice, is exactly the same 
as when you forget to add another prerequisite match to the rule, so it needs 
to be carefully looked into.
      </para>
      
      <screen>
work3:~# iptables -A INPUT --protocol tcp --destination-ports 67 -j ACCEPT
iptables v1.2.9: Unknown arg `--destination-ports'
Try `iptables -h' or 'iptables --help' for more information.
      </screen>
      
      <para>
There is also one more possible cause for the "Unknown arg" error shown above. 
If you can see that the argument is perfectly written, and no possible errors 
in the prerequisites, there is a possibility that the target/match/table was 
simply not compiled into the kernel. For example, let's say we forgot to 
compile the filter table support into the kernel, this would then look 
something like this:    
      </para>      
      
      <screen>
work3:~# iptables -A INPUT -j ACCEPT
iptables v1.2.9: can't initialize iptables table `filter': Table does not exist 
(do you need to insmod?)
Perhaps iptables or your kernel needs to be upgraded.
      </screen>
      <indexterm><primary>Errors</primary><secondary>Table does not
      exist</secondary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>Table does not exist error</primary></indexterm>
      
      <para>
Normally, iptables should be able to automatically modprobe a specific module 
that isn't already inside the kernel, so this is generally a sign of either not 
having done a proper depmod after restarting with the new kernel, or you may 
simply have forgotten about the module(s). If the problematic module would be a 
match instead, the error message would be a little bit more cryptic and hard to 
understand. For example, look at this error message.
      </para>
      
      <screen>
work3:~# iptables -A INPUT -m state 
--state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
iptables: No chain/target/match by that name
      </screen>
      
      <para>
In this case, we forgot to compile the state module, and as you can see the 
error message isn't very nice and easy to understand. But it does give you a 
hint at what is wrong. Finally, we have the same error again, but this time, 
the target is missing. As you understand from looking at the error message, it 
get's rather complicated since it is the exact same error message for both 
errors (missing match and/or target).
      </para>
      
      <screen>
work3:~# iptables -A INPUT -m state 
--state ESTABLISHED -j REJECT
iptables: No chain/target/match by that name
      </screen>
      
      <para>
The easiest way to see if we have simply forgotten to depmod, or if the module 
is actually missing is to look in the directory where the modules should be. 
This is the <filename>/lib/modules/2.6.4/kernel/net/ipv4/netfilter</filename> 
directory. All ipt_*<indexterm><primary>ipt_*</primary></indexterm> files that
are written in uppercase letters are targets, while all the ones with
lowercase letters are matches. For example,
<command>ipt_REJECT.ko</command><indexterm><primary>ipt_REJECT.ko</primary>
</indexterm> is a target, while the
<command>ipt_state.ko</command><indexterm><primary>ipt_state.ko</primary>
</indexterm> is a match.
      </para>
      
      <note>
        <para>
In 2.4 kernels and older, the file extension for all kernel modules was .o, 
which changed to .ko for files in the 2.6 kernels.
        </para>
      </note>
      
      <para>
Another way of getting help from iptables itself is to simply comment out a 
whole chain from your script to see if that fixes the problem. This is kind of 
a last resort problem solver, that may be very effective if you don't even know 
which chain is causing the problem. By removing the whole chain and simply 
setting a default policy of <command>ACCEPT</command>, and then testing, if it
works better, then this is the chain that is causing the problems. If it
doesn't work better, then it is another chain, and you can go on to find the
problem elsewhere.

There are of course other tools that may be extremely useful when debugging
your firewall scripts. This section will briefly touch the most common tools
used to find out fast how your firewall looks from all sides of it (inside,
outside, etc). The tools I have chosen here are the nmap and nessus tools.

<command>Nmap</command> is an excellent tool for looking at the pure firewall
perspective, and to find out which ports are open and more low level
information. It has support for OS fingerprinting, several different port
scanning methods, <command>IPv6</command> and <command>IPv4</command> support
and network scanning. 
        </para>
        
        <para>
The basic form of scanning is done with a very simple commandline syntax.
Don't forget to specify which ports to scan through with the
<command>-p</command> option, for example <command>-p 1-1024</command>. As an
example, take a look below.
        </para>

blueflux@work3:~$ nmap -p 1-1024 192.168.0.1

Starting nmap 3.50 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ ) at 2004-03-18 17:19 CET
Interesting ports on firewall (192.168.0.1):
(The 1021 ports scanned but not shown below are in state: closed)
PORT    STATE SERVICE
22/tcp  open  ssh
25/tcp  open  smtp
587/tcp open  submission

Nmap run completed -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 3.877 seconds

        <para>
It is also able to automatically guess the operating system of the scanned
host by doing <systemitem>OS fingerprinting</systemitem>. Fingerprinting
requires root privileges though, but it may also be very interesting to use to
find out what most people will think of the host. Using <systemitem>OS
fingerprinting</systemitem> may look something like the example listing
below.

OS fingerprinting isn't perfect, as you can see, but it will help narrow it 
down, both for you, and for the attacker. Hence, it is interesting for you to 
know as well. The best thing to do, is to give as little material as possible 
for the attacker to get a proper fingerprint on, and with this information you 
will know fairly well what the attacker knows about your OS as well.

        <para>
Nmap also comes with a graphical user interface that can be used, called the
nmapfe<indexterm><primary>Nmapfe</primary></indexterm> (<systemitem>Nmap Front
End</systemitem>). It is an excellent frontend of the nmap program, and if
you know that you will need a little bit more complicated searches, you may
wish to use it. For an example screenshot, take a look below.

Of course, the nmap tool has more usages than this, which you can find out more 
about on the nmap homepage. For more information, take a look at the <link 
linkend="nmap">Nmap</link> resources.
        </para>
        
        <para>
As you may understand, this is an excellent tool to test your host with, and to 
find out which ports are actually open and which are not. For example, after 
finishing your setup, use nmap to see if you have actually succeeded in doing 
what you wanted to do. Do you get the correct responses from the correct ports, 
and so on.

While <command>nmap</command> is more of a low level scanner, showing open
ports etcetera, the <command>nessus</command> program is an actual security
scanner. <command>Nmap</command> tries to connect to different ports, and to
find out at most, what kind of version the different servers are running.
<command>Nessus</command> takes this a step further, by finding all open
ports, finding out what is running on that specific port, what program and
which version is running, and then testing for different security threats to
that program, and finally creating a complete report of all the security
threats that are available.
        </para>
        
        <para>
As you can understand, this is an extremely useful tool to find out more about
your host. The program is built up in a server client way, so it should be
fairly easy to find out more about your firewall from the outside by using an
external <systemitem>nessus daemon</systemitem>, or internal for that matter.
The client is a <systemitem>graphical user interface</systemitem> where you
login to the <systemitem>nessus daemon</systemitem>, set your settings, and
specify which host you would like to scan for vulnerabilities. The generated
report may look something like in the example below.

<command>Nessus</command> should be used with some caution however, since it
can crash a machine or a service that it is specified to attack. Those attacks
that risk crashing a machine are per default turned off luckily.

In this chapter we have looked in detail at different techniques you can use to 
debug your firewall scripts. Debugging of firewall scripts can become rather 
tedious and longwinded, however it is a necessity. If you use some small simple 
steps while doing this, it can become very easy in the end as well. We have 
looked at the following techniques in particular:
