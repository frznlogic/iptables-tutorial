>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the
greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to
make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under
these terms.</P
><P
>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It
is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at
least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is
found.</P

    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c';
they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

> You should also get your employer (if you work as a
programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for
the program, if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
