<para>
You may run into a few problems with loading modules. For example, you could
get errors claiming that there is no module by such a name and so on. This may,
for example look like the following.
</para>

<screen>
insmod: iptable_filter: no module by that name found
</screen>

   <para>
   This is no reason for concern yet. This or these modules may possibly
have been statically compiled into your kernel. This is the first thing you
should look at when trying to solve this problem. The simplest way to see if
these modules have been loaded already or if they are statically compiled into
the kernel, is to simply try and run a command that uses the specific
functionality. In the above case, we could not load the
<systemitem>filter</systemitem> table. If this functionality is not there, we
should be unable to use the <systemitem>filter</systemitem> table at all. To
check if the <systemitem>filter</systemitem> table is there, we do the
following.
   </para>

   <screen>
<command>
iptables -t filter -L
</command>
   </screen>

   <para>
   This should either output all of the chains in the
<systemitem>filter</systemitem> table properly, or it should fail. If everything
is o.k., then it should look something like this depending on if you have
rules inserted or not.
   </para>

    <screen>
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
    </screen>

   <para>
   If you do not have the <systemitem>filter</systemitem> table loaded, you
would get an error that looks something like this instead.
   </para>

    <screen>
iptables v1.2.5: can't initialize iptables table `filter': Table \
     does not exist (do you need to insmod?)
Perhaps iptables or your kernel needs to be upgraded.
    </screen>

    <para>
This is a bit more serious since it points out that we, first of all, do not
have the functionality compiled into the kernel, and second, that the module is
not possible to find in our normal module paths. This may either mean that you
have forgotten to install your modules, you have forgotten to run
<command>depmod -a</command> to update your module databases, or you have not
compiled the functionality as either module or statically into the kernel. 
There may of course be other reasons for the module not to be loaded, but these 
are the main reasons. Most of these problems are easily solved. The first 
problem would simply be solved by running <command>make 
modules_install</command> in the kernel source directory (if the source has 
already been compiled and the modules have already been built). The second 
problem is solved by simply running <command>depmod -a</command> once and see 
if it works afterward. The third problem is a bit out of the league for this 
explanation, and you are more or less left to your own wits here. You will most 
probably find more information about this on the <link linkend="tldp" 
endterm="tldp.title"></link> homepage.
   </para>

   <para>
Another error that you may get when running iptables is the following error.
   </para>

   <screen>
iptables: No chain/target/match by that name
   </screen>

   <para>
   This error tells us that there is no such chain, target or match. This could
depend upon a huge set of factors, the most common being that you have
misspelled the chain, target or match in question. Also, this could be
generated in case you are trying to use a match that is not available, either
because you did not load the proper module, it was not compiled into the 
kernel, or iptables failed to automatically load the module. In general, you 
should look for all of the above solutions but also look for misspelled targets 
of some sort or another in your rule.

   </indexterm>

   <para>
   There is a certain <emphasis>feature</emphasis> in
<command>iptables</command> that is not so well documented and may therefore be
overlooked by a lot of people (yes, including me). If you use state
<command>NEW</command>, packets with the <systemitem>SYN</systemitem> bit unset
will get through your firewall. This feature is there because in certain cases
we want to consider that a packet may be part of an already
<command>ESTABLISHED</command> connection on, for instance, another firewall.
This feature makes it possible to have two or more firewalls, and for one of the
firewalls to go down without any loss of data. The firewalling of the subnet
could then be taken over by our secondary firewall. This does however lead to
the fact that state <command>NEW</command> will allow pretty much any kind of
TCP connection, regardless if this is the initial 3-way handshake or not. To
take care of this problem we add the following rules to our firewalls
<systemitem>INPUT</systemitem>, <systemitem>OUTPUT</systemitem> and
<systemitem>FORWARD</systemitem> chain:
   </para>

    <screen>
<command>
$IPTABLES -A INPUT -p tcp ! --syn -m state --state NEW -j LOG \
     --log-prefix "New not syn:"
$IPTABLES -A INPUT -p tcp ! --syn -m state --state NEW -j DROP
</command>
    </screen>

   <caution>
    <para>
    The above rules will take care of this problem. This is a badly documented
behavior of the <command>Netfilter</command>/<command>iptables</command>
project and should definitely be more highlighted. In other words, a huge
warning is in its place for this kind of behavior on your firewall.
    </para>
   </caution>


   <para>
Note that there are some troubles with the above rules and bad Microsoft TCP/IP
implementations. The above rules will lead to certain conditions where packets
generated by Microsoft product gets labeled as state <command>NEW</command>
and hence get logged and dropped. It will however not lead to broken
connections to my knowledge. The problem occurs when a connection gets closed,
the final <systemitem>FIN</systemitem>/<systemitem>ACK</systemitem> is
sent, the state machine of <command>Netfilter</command> closes
the connection and it is no longer in the conntrack table. At this point the
faulty Microsoft implementation sends another packet which is considered as
state <command>NEW</command> but lacks the <systemitem>SYN</systemitem> bit
and hence gets matched by the above rules. In other words, don't worry to much
about this rule, or if you are worried anyways, set the
<command>--log-headers</command> option to the rule and log the headers too
and you'll get a better look at what the packet looks like.

   </para>

   <para>
There is one more known problem with these rules. If someone is currently
connected to the firewall, let's say from the <systemitem>LAN</systemitem>,
and you have the script set to be activated when running a
<systemitem>PPP</systemitem> connection. In this case, when you start the
<systemitem>PPP</systemitem> connection, the person previously connected through
the <systemitem>LAN</systemitem> will be more or less killed. This only applies
when you are running with the conntrack and nat code bases as modules, and the
modules are loaded and unloaded each time you run the script. Another way to get
this problem is to run the <filename>rc.firewall.txt</filename> script from a
telnet connection from a host not on the actual firewall. To put it simply, you
connect with <command>telnet</command> or some other stream connection. Start
the connection tracking modules, then load the <command>NEW</command> not
<systemitem>SYN</systemitem> packet rules. Finally, the <command>telnet
client</command> or <command>daemon</command> tries to send something. the
connection tracking code will not recognize this connection as a legal
connection since it has not seen packets in any direction on this connection
before, also there will be no <systemitem>SYN</systemitem> bits set since it is
not actually the first packet in the connection. Hence, the packet will match to
the rules and be logged and after-wards dropped to the ground.

     <primary>Spoofing</primary>
   </indexterm>

   <para>
Certain <systemitem>TCP</systemitem> spoofing attacks uses a technique called
Sequence Number Prediction. In this type of attack, the attacker spoofs some
other hosts <systemitem>IP</systemitem> address, while  attacking someone, and
tries to predict the Sequence number used by that host. 
   </para>

   <para>
Let's look on typical <systemitem>TCP</systemitem> spoofing by sequence number
prediction. Players: "attacker" [A], trying to send packets to a "victim" [V],
pretending to be some "other host" [O].
   </para>

   <orderedlist>
<listitem><para>[A] sends SYN to [V] with source IP of [O].</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>[V] replies to [O] by SYN/ACK.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>now [O] should reply to an unknown SYN/ACK by RST and the
attack is unsuccesful, but let's assume [O] is down (flooded, turned off or
behind firewall that has dropped the packets).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>if [O] didn't mess it up, [A] now can talk to [V] pretending
to be [O] as long as it predicts correct sequence numbers.</para></listitem>
   </orderedlist>

   <para>
As long as we do not send the <systemitem>RST</systemitem> packet to the
unknown <systemitem>SYN/ACK</systemitem> in step 3, we will allow [V] to be
attacked, and ourselves to be incriminated. Common courtesy, would hence be to
send the <systemitem>RST</systemitem> to [V] in a proper way. If we use the
<systemitem>NEW</systemitem> not <systemitem>SYN</systemitem> rules specified
in the ruleset, <systemitem>SYN/ACK</systemitem> packets will be dropped.
Hence, we have the following rules in the
<systemitem>bad_tcp_packets</systemitem> chain, just above the NEW not SYN
rules:
   </para>

   <screen>
<command>
iptables -A bad_tcp_packets -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,ACK SYN,ACK \
-m state --state NEW -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
</command>
   </screen>

   <para>
The chance of being [O] in this scenario should be relatively small, but these 
rules should be safe in almost all cases. Except when you run several redundant 
firewalls which will often take over packets or streams from each other. In such
case, some connections may be blocked, even though they are legit. This rule 
may actually also allow a few portscans to see our firewall as well, but they 
should not be able to tell much more than that.

     <secondary>ISP using private IP's</secondary>
   </indexterm>

   <para>
   I have added this since a friend of mine told me something I have
totally forgotten. Certain stupid Internet Service Providers use
IP addresses assigned by <emphasis>IANA</emphasis> for their local
networks on which you connect to. For example, the Swedish Internet Service
Provider and phone monopoly Telia uses this approach for example on their
<systemitem>DNS</systemitem> servers, which uses the 10.x.x.x IP address range.
A common problem that you may run into when writing your scripts, is that you 
do not allow connections from any IP addresses in the 10.x.x.x range to 
yourself, because of spoofing possibilities. Well, here is unfortunately an 
example where you actually might have to lift a bit on those rules. You might 
just insert an <command>ACCEPT</command> rule above the spoof
section to allow traffic from those <systemitem>DNS</systemitem> servers, or
you could just comment out that part of the script. This is how it might look:
   </para>

   <screen>
<command>
/usr/local/sbin/iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -i eth1 -s \
     10.0.0.1/32 -j ACCEPT
</command>
   </screen>

   <para> I would like to take my moment to bitch at these Internet Service
Providers. These IP address ranges are not assigned for you to use for dumb
stuff like this, at least not to my knowledge. For large corporate sites it is
more than o.k., or your own home network, but you are not supposed to force us
to open up ourselves just because of some whim of yours. You are large Internet 
providers, and if you can't afford buying some 3-4 IP addresses for your 
<systemitem>DNS</systemitem> servers, I have a very hard time trusting you.

   </indexterm>

   <para>
   This is a fairly simple task really, once you get to know how
<systemitem>DHCP</systemitem> works, however, you must be a little bit cautious
with what you do let in and what you do not let in. First of all, we should know
that <systemitem>DHCP</systemitem> works over the <systemitem>UDP</systemitem>
protocol. Hence, this is the first thing to look for. Second, we should check
which interface we get and send the request from. For example, if our
<systemitem>eth0</systemitem> interface is set up with
<systemitem>DHCP</systemitem>, we should not allow <systemitem>DHCP</systemitem>
requests on <systemitem>eth1</systemitem>. To make the rule a bit more specific,
we only allow the actual <systemitem>UDP</systemitem> ports used by
<systemitem>DHCP</systemitem>, which should be ports 67 and 68.  These are the
criteria that we choose to match packets on, and that we allow. The rule would
now look like this:
   </para>

   <screen>
<command>
$IPTABLES  -I INPUT -i $LAN_IFACE -p udp --dport 67:68 --sport \
     67:68 -j ACCEPT
</command>
   </screen>

   <para>
   Do note that we allow all traffic to and from <systemitem>UDP</systemitem>
port 67 and 68 now, however, this should not be such a huge problem since it
only allows requests from hosts doing the connection from port 67 or 68 as well.
This rule could, of course, be even more restrictive, but it should be enough to
actually accept all <systemitem>DHCP</systemitem> requests and updates without
opening up too large of holes. If you are concerned, this rule could of course 
be made even more restrictive.

   </indexterm>

   <para>
   mIRC uses a special setting which allows it to connect through a firewall and
to make DCC connections work properly without the firewall knowing about it. If
this option is used together with iptables and specifically the ip_conntrack_irc
and ip_nat_irc modules, it will simply not work. The problem is that mIRC will
automatically NAT the inside of the packets for you, and when the packet reaches
the firewall, the firewall will simply not know how and what to do with it.
mIRC does not expect the firewall to be smart enough to take care of this by
itself by simply querying the IRC server for its IP address and sending DCC
requests with that address instead.
   </para>

   <para>
   Turning on the "I am behind a firewall" configuration option and using the
ip_conntrack_irc and ip_nat_irc modules will result in Netfilter creating log
entries with the following content "Forged DCC send packet".
   </para>

   <para>
   The simplest possible solution is to just uncheck that configuration option
in mIRC and let iptables do the work. This means, that you should tell mIRC
specifically that it is <emphasis>not</emphasis> behind a firewall.
