  <para>
This chapter and the upcoming three chapters will discuss at length how to 
build your own rules. A rule could be described as the directions the firewall 
will adhere to when blocking or permitting different connections and packets 
in a specific chain. Each line you write that's inserted in a chain should be 
considered a rule. We will also discuss the basic matches that are available, 
and how to use them, as well as the different targets and how we can construct 
new targets of our own (i.e.,new sub chains).
  </para>
  
  <para>
This chapter will deal with the raw basics of how a rule is created and how you 
write it and enter it so that it will be accepted by the userspace program 
<command>iptables</command>, the different tables, as well as the commands that 
you can issue to iptables. After that we will in the next chapter look at all 
the matches that are available to <command>iptables</command>, and then get 
more into detail of each type of target and jump.

   <para>
As we have already explained, each rule is a line that the kernel looks at to
find out what to do with a packet. If all the criteria - or matches - are met,
we perform the target - or jump - instruction. Normally we would write our
rules in a syntax that looks something like this:
   </para>

   <para>
    <cmdsynopsis>
     <command>iptables</command>
     <arg>-t <replaceable>table</replaceable></arg>
     <arg choice=plain>command</arg>
     <arg>match</arg>
     <arg>target/jump</arg>
    </cmdsynopsis>
   </para>

   <para>
There is nothing that says that the target instruction has to be the last 
function in the line. However, you would usually adhere to this syntax to get 
the best readability. Anyway, most of the rules you'll see are written in this 
way. Hence, if you read someone else's script, you'll most likely recognize the
syntax and easily understand the rule.
   </para>

   <para>
If you want to use a table other than the standard table, you could insert
the table specification at the point at which [table] is specified. However,
it is not necessary to state explicitly what table to use, since by default
<command>iptables</command> uses the <systemitem>filter</systemitem> table on
which to implement all commands. Neither do you have to specify the table at
just this point in the rule. It could be set pretty much anywhere along the
line. However, it is more or less standard to put the table specification at
the beginning.
   </para>

   <para>
One thing to think about though: The command should always come first, or
alternatively directly after the table specification. We use 'command' to tell
the program what to do, for example to insert a rule or to add a rule to the
end of the chain, or to delete a rule. We shall take a further look at this
below.
   </para>

   <para>
The match is the part of the rule that we send to the kernel that details the
specific character of the packet, what makes it different from all other
packets. Here we could specify what IP address the packet comes from, from
which network interface, the intended IP address, port, protocol or whatever.
There is a heap of different matches that we can use that we will look closer
at further on in this chapter.
   </para>

   <para>
Finally we have the target of the packet. If all the matches are met for a
packet, we tell the kernel what to do with it. We could, for example, tell the
kernel to send the packet to another chain that we've created ourselves, and
which is part of this particular table. We could tell the kernel to drop the
packet dead and do no further processing, or we could tell the kernel to send
a specified reply to the sender. As with the rest of the content in this
section, we'll look closer at it further on in the chapter.

The <systemitem>nat</systemitem> table is used mainly for <systemitem>Network
Address Translation</systemitem>. "<systemitem>NAT</systemitem>"ed packets
get their  IP  addresses  altered, according to our rules. Packets  in a
stream only traverse this table once. We assume that the first  packet  of  a
stream is allowed. The rest of the packets in the same  stream are
automatically "<systemitem>NAT</systemitem>"ed or Masqueraded etc, and will be
subject  to the same actions as the first packet. These will, in other words,
not  go  through  this  table again, but will nevertheless be treated  like
the first packet in the stream. This is the main reason why  you  should  not
do  any  filtering in this table, which we will discuss at greater length
further on. The <systemitem>PREROUTING</systemitem> chain is used to alter
packets as soon as they get in to the firewall. The
<systemitem>OUTPUT</systemitem> chain is used for altering locally generated
packets (i.e., on the firewall) before they get to the routing decision.
Finally  we have the <systemitem>POSTROUTING</systemitem> chain which is used
to alter packets just as they are about to leave the firewall.</para></entry>
       </row>
       <row>
        <entry>mangle</entry>
        <entry><para>
This table is used mainly for mangling packets. Among other things, we can
change the contents of different packets and that of their headers. Examples
of this would be to change the <command>TTL</command>, <command>TOS</command>
or <command>MARK</command>. Note that the <command>MARK</command> is not
really a change to the packet, but a mark value for the packet is set in
kernel space. Other rules or programs might use this mark further along in the
firewall to filter or do advanced routing on; tc is one example. The table
consists of five built in chains, the <systemitem>PREROUTING</systemitem>,
<systemitem>POSTROUTING</systemitem>, <systemitem>OUTPUT</systemitem>,
<systemitem>INPUT</systemitem> and <systemitem>FORWARD</systemitem> chains.
<systemitem>PREROUTING</systemitem> is used for altering packets just as they
enter the firewall and before they hit the routing decision.
<systemitem>POSTROUTING</systemitem> is used to mangle packets just after all
routing decisions have been made. <systemitem>OUTPUT</systemitem> is used for
altering locally generated packets after they enter the routing decision.
<systemitem>INPUT</systemitem> is used to alter packets after they have been
routed to the local computer itself, but before the user space application
actually sees the data. <systemitem>FORWARD</systemitem> is used to mangle
packets after they have hit the first routing decision, but before they
actually hit the last routing decision. Note that mangle can't be used for any
kind of <systemitem>Network Address Translation</systemitem> or
<systemitem>Masquerading</systemitem>, the nat table was made for these kinds
of operations.

       <row>
        <entry>filter</entry>
        <entry><para>
The <systemitem>filter</systemitem> table should be used exclusively for
filtering packets. For example, we could <command>DROP</command>,
<command>LOG</command>, <command>ACCEPT</command> or <command>REJECT</command>
packets without problems, as we can in the other tables. There are three
chains built in to this table. The first one is named
<systemitem>FORWARD</systemitem> and is used on all non-locally generated
packets that are not destined for our local host (the firewall, in other
words). <systemitem>INPUT</systemitem> is used on all packets that are
destined for our local host (the firewall) and <systemitem>OUTPUT</systemitem>
is finally used for all locally generated packets.

         <entry>raw</entry>
	 <entry><para>
The <systemitem>raw</systemitem> table and its chains are used before any
other tables in netfilter. It was introduced to use the
<command>NOTRACK</command> target. This table is rather new and is only
available, if compiled, with late 2.6 kernels and later. The raw table
contains two chains. The <systemitem>PREROUTING</systemitem> and
<systemitem>OUTPUT</systemitem> chain, where they will handle packets before
they hit any of the other netfilter subsystems. The
<systemitem>PREROUTING</systemitem> chain can be used for all incoming packets
to this machine, or that are forwarded, while the
<systemitem>OUTPUT</systemitem> chain can be used to alter the locally
generated packets before they hit any of the other netfilter subsystems.

    <para>The above details should have explained the basics about the three
different tables that are available. They should be used for totally different
purposes, and you should know what to use each chain for. If you do not
understand their usage, you may well dig a pit for yourself in your firewall,
into which you will fall as soon as someone finds it and pushes you into it.
We have already discussed the requisite tables and chains in more detail
within the <link linkend="traversingoftables"
endterm="traversingoftables.title"></link> chapter. If you do not understand
this fully, I advise you to go back and read through it again.

In this section we will cover all the different commands and what can be done
with them. The command tells <command>iptables</command> what to do with the
rest of the rule that we send to the parser. Normally we would want either to
add or delete something in some table or another. The following commands are
available to iptables:

        <entry>This command deletes a rule in a chain. This could be done
in two ways; either by entering the whole rule to match (as in the first
example), or by specifying the rule number that you want to match. If you use
the first method, your entry must match the entry in the chain exactly. If you
use the second method, you must match the number of the rule you want to
delete. The rules are numbered from the top of each chain, starting with
number 1.</entry>

        <entry>Insert a rule somewhere in a chain. The rule is inserted as

now on it would be the very first rule in the chain.

In the above case, we would list all the entries in the
<systemitem>INPUT</systemitem> chain. It's also legal to not specify any chain
at all. In the last case, the command would list all the chains in the 
specified table (To specify a table, see the <link linkend="tables"

other options sent to the parser, for example the <command>-n</command> and

option with the <command>-L</command> command, you have probably seen the
packet counter at the beginning of each field. To zero this packet counter,
use the <command>-Z</command> option. This option works the same as
<command>-L</command>, except that <command>-Z</command> won't list the rules.
If <command>-L</command> and <command>-Z</command> is used together (which is
legal), the chains will first be listed, and then the packet counters are
zeroed.</entry>

this command to work, there must be no rules that refer to the chain that is

        <entry>The <command>-E</command> command tells
<command>iptables</command> to change the first name of a chain, to the second
name. In the example above we would, in other words, change the name of the
chain from <varname>allowed</varname> to <varname>disallowed</varname>. Note
that this will not affect the actual way the table will work. It is, in other
words, just a cosmetic change to the table.</entry>

You should always enter a complete command line, unless you just want
to list the built-in help for <command>iptables</command> or get the version 
of the
command. To get the version, use the <command>-v</command> option and to get 
the help

comes a few options that can be used with various different commands. Note
that we tell you with which commands the options can be used and what effect
they will have. Also note that we do not include any options here that
affect rules or matches. Instead, we'll take a look at matches and

        <entry>Explanation</entry>
        <entry>This command gives verbose output and is mainly
used together with the <command>--list</command> command. If used together 
with
the <command>--list</command> command, it outputs the interface address, rule
options and TOS masks. The <command>--list</command> command will also include
a bytes and packet counter for each rule, if the <command>--verbose</command>
option is set. These counters uses the K (x1000), M (x1,000,000) and G
(x1,000,000,000) multipliers. To overrule this and get exact output, you
can use the <command>-x</command> option, described later. If this option is
used with the <command>--append</command>, <command>--insert</command>,
<command>--delete</command> or <command>--replace</command> commands, the
program will output detailed information on how the rule was interpreted and
whether it was inserted correctly, etc.</entry>

       <row>
        <entry>Explanation</entry>
        <entry>This option expands the numerics. The output from
<command>--list</command> will in other words not contain the K, M or G
multipliers. Instead we will get an exact output from the packet and byte
counters of how many packets and bytes that have matched the rule in question.
Note that this option is only usable in the <command>--list</command> command
and isn't really relevant for any of the other commands.

       <row>
        <entry>Explanation</entry>
        <entry>This option tells iptables to output numerical
values. IP addresses and port numbers will be printed by using their
numerical values and not host-names, network names or application names.
This option is only applicable to the <command>--list</command> command. This
option overrides the default of resolving all numerics to hosts and names,
where this is possible.</entry>

        <entry>Explanation</entry>
        <entry>The <command>--line-numbers</command> command, together with
the <command>--list</command> command, is used to output line numbers. Using
this option, each rule is output with its number. It could be convenient to
know which rule has which number when inserting rules. This option only works
with the <command>--list</command> command.</entry>

       <row>
        <entry>Explanation</entry>
        <entry>This option is used when creating a rule or modifying it in
some way. We can then use the option to initialize the packet and byte
counters for the rule. The syntax would be something like
<command>--set-counters 20 4000</command>, which would tell the kernel to set
the packet counter to 20 and byte counter to 4000.</entry>

        <entry>Explanation</entry>
        <entry>The <command>--modprobe</command> option is used to tell
<command>iptables</command> which module to use when probing for modules or
adding them to the kernel. It could be used if your
<command>modprobe</command> command is not somewhere in the search path etc.
In such cases, it might be necessary to specify this option so the program
knows what to do in case a needed module is not loaded. This option can be
used with all commands.</entry>

    <title>What's next?</title>

    <para>
This chapter has discussed some of the basic commands for iptables and the
tables very briefly that can be used in netfilter. The commands makes it
possible to do quite a lot of different operations on the netfilter package
loaded inside kernel as you have seen.
    </para>

    <para>
The next chapter will discuss all the available matches in iptables and
netfilter. This is a very heavy and long chapter, and I humbly suggest that
you don't need to actually learn every single match available in any detail,
except the ones that you are going to use. A good idea might be to get a brief
understanding of what each match does, and then get a better grasp on them as
you need them.
