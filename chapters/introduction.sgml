   <para> Well, I found a big empty space in the HOWTO's out there lacking
in information about the iptables and Netfilter functions in the new Linux
2.4.x kernels. Among other things, I'm going to try to answer questions
that some might have about the new possibilities like state matching.  
Most of this will be illustrated with an example <link 
linkend="rcfirewalltxt" endterm="rcfirewalltxt.title"></link> file that you 
can use in your <filename>/etc/rc.d/</filename> scripts. Yes, this file was 
originally based upon the masquerading HOWTO for those of you who recognize 
it.
   </para>

   <para> Also, there's a small script that I wrote just in case you screw
up as much as I did during the configuration available as <link
linkend="rcflush-iptablestxt" endterm="rcflush-iptablestxt.title"></link>.
   </para>

   <title id="howitwas.title">How it was written</title>

   <para>
I originally wrote this as a very small tutorial for boingworld.com, which was 
an Amiga/Linux/General newssite that a small group of people, including me, 
ran a couple of years back. Due to the fantastic amount of readers and 
comments that I got from it, I continued to write on it. The original version 
was approximately 10-15 A4 pages in printed version and has since been growing 
slowly but steadily. A huge amount of people has helped me out, spellchecking, 
bug corrections, etc. At the time of writing this, the 
http://iptables-tutorial.frozentux.net/ site has had over 600.000 unique hits 
alone. 
   </para>

   <para>
This document was written to guide you through the setup process step by step 
and hopefully help you to understand some more about the iptables package. I 
have based most of the stuff here on the example rc.firewall file, since I 
found that example to be a good way to learn how to use iptables. I 
decided to just follow the basic chain structure and from there walk
through each and one of the chains traversed and explain how the script works. 
That way the tutorial is a little bit harder to follow, though this way is 
more logical. Whenever you find something that's hard to understand, just come 
back to this tutorial.

     <primary>Terms</primary>
   </indexterm>
   <indexterm zone="termsused">
     <primary>Words</primary>
   </indexterm>

   <para>
This document contains a few terms that may need more detailed 
explanations before you read them. This section will try to cover the most 
obvious ones and how I have chosen to use them within this document.
   </para>

   <para>
Connection<indexterm><primary>Connection</primary></indexterm> - This is
generally referred to in this document as a series of packets relating to each
other. These packets refer to each other as an established kind of connection.
A connection is in another word a series of exchanged packets. In TCP, this
mainly means establishing a connection via the 3-way handshake, and then this
is considered a connection until the release handshake.
   </para>

   <para>
DNAT<indexterm><primary>DNAT</primary></indexterm> - Destination Network
Address Translation. <systemitem>DNAT</systemitem> refers to the technique of
translating the <systemitem>Destination IP</systemitem> address of a packet,
or to change it simply put. This is used together with
<systemitem>SNAT</systemitem> to allow several hosts to share a single
Internet routable <systemitem>IP address</systemitem>, and to still provide
Server Services. This is normally done by assigning different ports with an
Internet routable <systemitem>IP address</systemitem>, and then tell the Linux
router where to send the traffic.
   </para>

   <para>
IPSEC<indexterm><primary>IPSEC</primary></indexterm> - Internet Protocol
Security is a protocol used to encrypt <systemitem>IPv4</systemitem> packets
and sending them securely over the Internet. For more information on
<systemitem>IPSEC</systemitem>, look in the <link linkend="otherresources"
endterm="otherresources.title"></link> appendix for other resources on the
topic.
   </para>

   <para>
Kernel space<indexterm><primary>Kernel space</primary></indexterm> - This is
more or less the opposite of <systemitem>User space</systemitem>. This implies
the actions that take place within the kernel, and not outside of the kernel.
   </para>

   <para>
Packet<indexterm><primary>Packet</primary></indexterm> - A singular unit sent
over a network, containing a header and a data portion. For example, an
<systemitem>IP</systemitem> packet or an <systemitem>TCP</systemitem> packet.
In <systemitem>Request For Comments</systemitem>
(<systemitem>RFC</systemitem>'s) a packet isn't so generalized, instead
<systemitem>IP</systemitem> packets are called datagrams, while
<systemitem>TCP</systemitem> packets are called segments. I have chosen to
call pretty much everything packets in this document for simplicity.
   </para>

   <para>
QoS<indexterm><primary>QoS</primary></indexterm> - Quality of Service is a way
of specifying how a packet should be handled and what kind of service quality
it should receive while sending it. For more information on this topic, take a
look in the <link linkend="tcpiprepetition"
endterm="tcpiprepetition.title"></link> chapter as well as the <link
linkend="otherresources" endterm="otherresources.title"></link> appendix for
external resources on the subject.
   </para>

   <para>
Segment<indexterm><primary>Segment</primary></indexterm> - A
<systemitem>TCP</systemitem> segment is pretty much the same as an packet, but
a formalized word for a <systemitem>TCP</systemitem> packet. 
   </para>

   <para>
Stream<indexterm><primary>Stream</primary></indexterm> - This term refers to a
connection that sends and receives packets that are related to each other in
some fashion. Basically, I have used this term for any kind of connection that
sends two or more packets in both directions. In <systemitem>TCP</systemitem>
this may mean a connection that sends a <systemitem>SYN</systemitem> and then
replies with an <systemitem>SYN/ACK</systemitem>, but it may also mean a
connection that sends a <systemitem>SYN</systemitem> and then replies with an
<systemitem>ICMP Host unreachable</systemitem>. In other words, I use this
term very loosely.
   </para>

   <para>
SNAT<indexterm><primary>SNAT</primary></indexterm> - <systemitem>Source
Network Address Translation</systemitem>. This refers to the techniques used
to translate one source address to another in a packet. This is used to make
it possible for several hosts to share a single Internet routable
<systemitem>IP</systemitem> address, since there is currently a shortage of
available <systemitem>IP</systemitem> addresses in
<systemitem>IPv4</systemitem> (<systemitem>IPv6</systemitem> will solve
this).
   </para>

   <para> 
State<indexterm><primary>State match</primary></indexterm> - This term refers to
which state the packet is in, either according to <link linkend="rfc793"
endterm="rfc793.title"></link> or according to userside states used in
<systemitem>Netfilter/iptables</systemitem>. Note that the used states
internally, and externally, do not follow the <systemitem>RFC 793</systemitem>
<indexterm><primary>RFC</primary><secondary>793</secondary></indexterm>
specification fully. The main reason is that
<systemitem>Netfilter</systemitem> has to make several assumptions about the
connections and packets.
   </para>

   <para>
User space<indexterm><primary>User space</primary></indexterm> - With this
term I mean everything and anything that takes place outside the kernel. For
example, invoking <command>iptables -h</command> takes place outside the
kernel, while <command>iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -j ACCEPT</command> takes
place (partially) within the kernel, since a new rule is added to the
ruleset.
   </para>

   <para>
Userland<indexterm><primary>Userland</primary></indexterm> - See User space.
   </para>

   <para>
VPN<indexterm><primary>VPN</primary></indexterm> - Virtual Private Network is
a technique used to create virtually private networks over non-private
networks, such as the Internet. <systemitem>IPSEC</systemitem> is one
technique used to create <systemitem>VPN</systemitem> connections.
<systemitem>OpenVPN</systemitem> is another.
   </para>

   <title>What's next?</title>

   <para>
This chapter has given some small insight into why this document was written
and how it was written. It also explained some common terms used throughout
the document.
   </para>

   <para>
The next chapter will bring up a rather lengthy introduction and repetition to
TCP/IP. Basically this means the IP protocol and some of its sub-protocols
that are commonly used with iptables and netfilter. These are TCP, UDP, ICMP
and SCTP. SCTP is a rather new standard in comparison to the other protocols,
hence quite a lot of space and time has gone into describing this protocol for
all of those who are still not quite familiar with it. The next chapter will
also discuss some basic and more advanced routing techniques used today.
