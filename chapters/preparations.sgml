  <para>
  This chapter is aimed at getting you started and to help you understand
the role Netfilter and <command>iptables</command> play in Linux today.
This chapter should hopefully get you set up and finished to go with your
experimentation, and installation of your firewall. Given time and
perseverance, you'll then get it to perform exactly as you want it to.

   <para>
The <command>iptables</command> user-space package can be
downloaded from the <link linkend="netfilter.org" 
endterm="netfilter.org.title"></link>. The <command>iptables</command> 
package also makes use of kernel space facilities which can be configured 
into the kernel during <command>make configure</command>. The necessary 
steps will be discussed a bit further down in this document.

    <para>
To run the pure basics of <command>iptables</command> you need to configure 
the following options into the kernel while doing <command>make 
config</command> or one of its related commands:
   </para>

   <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_PACKET</computeroutput> - This option allows
applications and utilities that need to work directly with various network 
devices. Examples of such utilities are tcpdump or snort.
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_PACKET</computeroutput> is strictly speaking not needed
for iptables to work, but since it contains so many uses, I have chosen to
include it here. If you do not want it, don't include it.
    </para>
   </note>

   <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_NETFILTER</computeroutput> - This option is required if 
you're going to use your computer as a firewall or gateway to the Internet. In 
other words, this is most definitely required for anything in this tutorial 
to work at all. I assume you will want this, since you are reading this.
   </para>

   <para>
And of course you need to add the proper drivers for your interfaces to work
properly, i.e. Ethernet adapter, <systemitem>PPP</systemitem> and
<systemitem>SLIP</systemitem> interfaces. The above will only add some of the
pure basics in iptables. You won't be able to do anything productive to be
honest, it just adds the framework to the kernel. If you want to use the more
advanced options in Iptables, you need to set up the proper configuration
options in your kernel. Here we will show you the options available in a basic
2.4.9 kernel and a brief explanation:
   </para>

   <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK</computeroutput> - This module is
needed to make connection tracking. Connection tracking is used by, among
other things, <systemitem>NAT</systemitem> and
<systemitem>Masquerading</systemitem>. If you need to firewall machines on a
<systemitem>LAN</systemitem> you most definitely should mark this option. For
example, this module is required by the <link linkend="rcfirewalltxt"
endterm="rcfirewalltxt.title"></link> script to work.
   </para>

   <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_FTP</computeroutput> - This module is required if
you want to do connection tracking on <systemitem>FTP</systemitem>
connections. Since <systemitem>FTP</systemitem> connections are quite hard to
do connection tracking on in normal cases, conntrack needs a so called helper;
this option compiles the helper. If you do not add this module you won't be
able to FTP through a firewall or gateway properly.
   </para>

   <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_IPTABLES</computeroutput> - This option is
required if you want do any kind of filtering,
<systemitem>masquerading</systemitem> or <systemitem>NAT</systemitem>. It adds
the whole iptables identification framework to the kernel. Without this you
won't be able to do anything at all with iptables.
   </para>

   <para> 
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_LIMIT</computeroutput> - This module isn't
exactly required but it's used in the example <link linkend="rcfirewalltxt"
endterm="rcfirewalltxt.title"></link>. This option provides the LIMIT match,
that adds the possibility to control how many packets per minute that are to
be matched, governed by an appropriate rule. For example, <command>-m limit
--limit 3/minute</command> would match a maximum of 3 packets per minute. This
module can also be used to avoid certain Denial of Service attacks.
   </para>

   <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_MAC</computeroutput> - This allows us to
match packets based on <systemitem>MAC</systemitem> addresses. Every Ethernet
adapter has its own <systemitem>MAC</systemitem> address. We could for
instance block packets based on what <systemitem>MAC</systemitem> address is
used and block a certain computer pretty well since the
<systemitem>MAC</systemitem> address very seldom changes. We don't use this
option in the <link linkend="rcfirewalltxt"
endterm="rcfirewalltxt.title"></link> example or anywhere else.
   </para>

   <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_MARK</computeroutput> - This allows us to
use a <command>MARK</command> match. For example, if we use the target
<command>MARK</command> we could mark a packet and then depending on if this
packet is marked further on in the table, we can match based on this mark. This
option is the actual match <command>MARK</command>, and further down we will
describe the actual target <command>MARK</command>.
   </para>

   <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_MULTIPORT</computeroutput> - This module
allows us to match packets with a whole range of destination ports or source
ports. Normally this wouldn't be possible, but with this match it is.
   </para>

   <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TOS</computeroutput> - With this match we
can match packets based on their <systemitem>TOS</systemitem> field.
<systemitem>TOS</systemitem> stands for <emphasis>Type Of Service</emphasis>.
<systemitem>TOS</systemitem> can also be set by certain rules in the
<systemitem>mangle</systemitem> table and via the ip/tc commands.
   </para>

   <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TCPMSS</computeroutput> - This option adds
the possibility for us to match <systemitem>TCP</systemitem> packets based on
their <systemitem>MSS</systemitem> field.
   </para>

   <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_STATE</computeroutput> - This is one of the
biggest news in comparison to <command>ipchains</command>. With this module we
can do stateful matching on packets. For example, if we have already seen
traffic in two directions in a <systemitem>TCP</systemitem> connection, this
packet will be counted as <command>ESTABLISHED</command>. This module is used
extensively in the <link linkend="rcfirewalltxt"
endterm="rcfirewalltxt.title"></link> example.
   </para>

   <para> 
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_UNCLEAN</computeroutput> - This module will
add the possibility for us to match <systemitem>IP</systemitem>,
<systemitem>TCP</systemitem>, <systemitem>UDP</systemitem> and
<systemitem>ICMP</systemitem> packets that don't conform to type or are
invalid. We could for example drop these packets, but we never know if they
are legitimate or not. Note that this match is still experimental and might
not work perfectly in all cases.
   </para>

   <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_OWNER</computeroutput> - This option will
add the possibility for us to do matching based on the owner of a socket. For
example, we can allow only the user root to have Internet access. This module
was originally just written as an example on what could be done with the new
<command>iptables</command>. Note that this match is still experimental and
might not work for everyone.
   </para>

   <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_FILTER</computeroutput> - This module will add
the basic <systemitem>filter</systemitem> table which will enable you to do
<systemitem>IP</systemitem> filtering at all. In the
<systemitem>filter</systemitem> table you'll find the
<systemitem>INPUT</systemitem>, <systemitem>FORWARD</systemitem> and
<systemitem>OUTPUT</systemitem> chains. This module is required if you plan to
do any kind of filtering on packets that you receive and send. 
   </para>

   <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_REJECT</computeroutput> - This target
allows us to specify that an <systemitem>ICMP</systemitem> error message
should be sent in reply to incoming packets, instead of plainly dropping them
dead to the floor. Keep in mind that <systemitem>TCP</systemitem> connections,
as opposed to <systemitem>ICMP</systemitem> and <systemitem>UDP</systemitem>,
are always reset or refused with a <systemitem>TCP RST</systemitem> packet.
   </para>

   <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_MIRROR</computeroutput> - This allows
packets to be bounced back to the sender of the packet. For example, if we set
up a <systemitem>MIRROR</systemitem> target on destination port
<systemitem>HTTP</systemitem> on our <systemitem>INPUT</systemitem> chain and
someone tries to access this port, we would bounce his packets back to him and
finally he would probably see his own homepage.
   </para>
   
   <warning>
     <para>
The <systemitem>MIRROR</systemitem> target is not to be used lightly. It was
originally built as a test and example module, and will most probably be very
dangerous to the person setting it up (resulting in serious DDoS if among
other things).
     </para>
   </warning>

   <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT</computeroutput> - This module allows
<systemitem>network address translation</systemitem>, or
<systemitem>NAT</systemitem>, in its different forms. This option gives us
access to the nat table in iptables. This option is required if we want to do
port forwarding, masquerading, etc. Note that this option is not required for
firewalling and masquerading of a <systemitem>LAN</systemitem>, but you should
have it present unless you are able to provide unique IP addresses for all
hosts. Hence, this option is required for the example <link
linkend="rcfirewalltxt" endterm="rcfirewalltxt.title"></link> script to work
properly, and most definitely on your network if you do not have the ability
to add unique IP addresses as specified above.
   </para>

   <para> 
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_MASQUERADE</computeroutput> - This module
adds the <command>MASQUERADE</command> target. For instance if we don't know
what IP we have to the Internet this would be the preferred way of getting the
IP instead of using <systemitem>DNAT</systemitem> or
<systemitem>SNAT</systemitem>. In other words, if we use
<systemitem>DHCP</systemitem>, <systemitem>PPP</systemitem>,
<systemitem>SLIP</systemitem> or some other connection that assigns us an IP,
we need to use this target instead of <systemitem>SNAT</systemitem>.
Masquerading gives a slightly higher load on the computer than
<systemitem>NAT</systemitem>, but will work without us knowing the IP address
in advance.
   </para>

   <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_REDIRECT</computeroutput> - This target is
useful together with <systemitem>application proxies</systemitem>, for
example. Instead of letting a packet pass right through, we remap them to go
to our local box instead. In other words, we have the possibility to make a
<systemitem>transparent proxy</systemitem> this way.
   </para>

   <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_LOG</computeroutput> - This adds the
<command>LOG</command> target and its functionality to
<command>iptables</command>. We can use this module to log certain packets to
syslogd and hence see what is happening to the packet. This is invaluable for
security audits, forensics or debugging a script you are writing.
   </para>

   <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_TCPMSS</computeroutput> - This option can
be used to counter Internet Service Providers and servers who block
<systemitem>ICMP Fragmentation Needed</systemitem> packets. This can result in
web-pages not getting through, small mails getting through while larger mails
don't, ssh works but scp dies after handshake, etc. We can then use the
<systemitem>TCPMSS</systemitem> target to overcome this by clamping our
<systemitem>MSS</systemitem> (Maximum Segment Size) to the
<systemitem>PMTU</systemitem> (Path Maximum Transmit Unit). 
   </para>

   <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_COMPAT_IPCHAINS</computeroutput> - Adds a
compatibility mode with the obsolete <command>ipchains</command>. Do not look
to this as any real long term solution for solving migration from Linux 2.2
kernels to 2.4 kernels, since it may well be gone with kernel 2.6.
   </para>

   <para>
<computeroutput>CONFIG_IP_NF_COMPAT_IPFWADM</computeroutput> - Compatibility
mode with obsolescent <command>ipfwadm</command>. Definitely don't look to
this as a real long term solution.
   </para>

   <para> As you can see, there is a heap of options. I have briefly
explained here what kind of extra behaviors you can expect from each
module. These are only the options available in a vanilla Linux 2.4.9
kernel. If you would like to take a look at more options, I suggest you
look at the <systemitem>patch-o-matic (POM)</systemitem> functions in
<systemitem>Netfilter</systemitem> user-land which will add heaps of other
options in the kernel. <systemitem>POM</systemitem> fixes are additions
that are supposed to be added in the kernel in the future but have not
quite reached the kernel yet. This may be for various reasons
- such as the patch not being stable yet, to Linus Torvalds being unable
to keep up, or not wanting to let the patch in to the mainstream kernel
yet since it is still experimental.
   </para>

   <para> You will need the following options compiled into your kernel,
or as modules, for the <link linkend="rcfirewalltxt"
endterm="rcfirewalltxt.title"></link> script to work. If you need help
with the options that the other scripts need, look at the example firewall
scripts section.

   <para> At the very least the above will be required for the <link
linkend="rcfirewalltxt" endterm="rcfirewalltxt.title"></link> script. In
the other example scripts I will explain what requirements they have in
their respective sections. For now, let's try to stay focused on the main
script which you should be studying now.
   </para>

     <secondary>User-land setup</secondary>
   </indexterm>

   <para> First of all, let's look at how we compile the
<command>iptables</command> package. It's important to realize that for
the most part configuration and compilation of iptables goes hand in hand with
the kernel configuration and compilation. Certain distributions come with
the <command>iptables</command> package preinstalled, one of these is Red
Hat. However, in old Red Hat it is disabled per default. We will check closer
on how to enable it and take a look at other distributions further on in
this chapter.
   </para>

   <section id="compilinguserapps">
    <title id="compilinguserapps.title">Compiling the user-land applications</title>
    <indexterm zone="compilinguserapps">
      <primary>Basics</primary>
      <secondary>Compiling iptables</secondary>
    </indexterm>
 
    <para> First of all unpack the <command>iptables</command> package.
Here, we have used the <emphasis>iptables 1.2.6a</emphasis> package and a
vanilla 2.4 kernel. Unpack as usual, using <command>bzip2 -cd
iptables-1.2.6a.tar.bz2 | tar -xvf -</command> (this can also be
accomplished with the <command>tar -xjvf
iptables-1.2.6a.tar.bz2</command>, which should do pretty much the same as
the first command. However, this may not work with older versions of
<command>tar</command>). The package should now be unpacked properly into
a directory named <computeroutput>iptables-1.2.6a</computeroutput>. For
more information read the <filename>iptables-1.2.6a/INSTALL</filename>
file which contains pretty good information on compiling and getting the
program to run.
    </para>

    <para> After this, there you have the option of configuring and
installing extra modules and options etcetera for the kernel.The step
described here will only check and install standard patches that are
pending for inclusion to the kernel, there are some even more experimental
patches further along, which may only be available when you carry out
other steps.
    </para>
    <note>
     <para>
    Some of these patches are highly experimental and may not be such a
good idea to install them. However, there are heaps of extremely
interesting matches and targets in this installation step so don't be
afraid of at least looking at them.
     </para>

     <para> To carry out this step we do something like this from the root
of the iptables package:
     </para>
    </note>

    <para>
     <command>make pending-patches KERNEL_DIR=/usr/src/linux/</command>
    </para>

    <para>
The variable <varname>KERNEL_DIR</varname> should point to the actual place that
your kernel source is located at. Normally this should be
<filename>/usr/src/linux/</filename> but this may vary, and most probably you
will know yourself where the kernel source is available.
    </para>

     <para> 
The above command only asks about certain patches that are just about to
enter the kernel anyway. There might be more patches and additions that
the developers of Netfilter are about to add to the kernel, but is a bit
further away from actually getting there. One way to install these is by
doing the following:
     </para>

    <para>
<command>make most-of-pom KERNEL_DIR=/usr/src/linux/</command>
    </para>

    <para> 
The above command would ask about installing parts of what in
Netfilter world is called <command>patch-o-matic</command>, but still skip
the most extreme patches that might cause havoc in your kernel. Note that
we say ask, because that's what these commands actually do. They ask you
before anything is changed in the kernel source. To be able to install
<emphasis>all</emphasis> of the <systemitem>patch-o-matic</systemitem>
stuff you will need to run the following command:
    </para>

    <para>
     <command>make patch-o-matic KERNEL_DIR=/usr/src/linux/</command>
    </para>

    <para>
Don't forget to read the help for each patch thoroughly before doing anything. 
Some patches will destroy other patches while others may destroy your kernel 
if used together with some patches from <systemitem>patch-o-matic</systemitem>
etc.
    </para>

    <note>
     <para>
You may totally ignore the above steps if you don't want to
patch your kernel, it is in other words not necessary to do the above. However,
there are some really interesting things in the
<systemitem>patch-o-matic</systemitem> that you may want to look at so there's
nothing bad in just running the commands and see what they contain.
     </para>
    </note>

    <para> After this you are finished doing the
<systemitem>patch-o-matic</systemitem> parts of installation, you may now
compile a new kernel making use of the new patches that you have added to
the source. Don't forget to configure the kernel again since the new
patches probably are not added to the configured options. You may wait
with the kernel compilation until after the compilation of the user-land
program <command>iptables</command> if you feel like it, though.
    </para>

    <para>
Continue by compiling the <command>iptables</command> user-land application. To
compile <command>iptables</command> you issue a simple command that looks like
this:
    </para>

    <para>
     <command>make KERNEL_DIR=/usr/src/linux/</command>
    </para>

    <para> The user-land application should now compile properly. If not,
you are on your own, or you could subscribe to the <link
linkend="netfilterlist">Netfilter mailing list</link>, where you have the
chance of asking for help with your problems. There are a few things
that might go wrong with the installation of <command>iptables</command>,
so don't panic if it won't work. Try to think logically about it and find
out what's wrong, or get someone to help you.
    </para>

    <para> If everything has worked smoothly, you're ready to install the
binaries by now. To do this, you would issue the following command to
install them:
    </para>

    <para>
<command>make install KERNEL_DIR=/usr/src/linux/</command>
    </para>

    <para> Hopefully everything should work in the program now. To use any
of the changes in the <command>iptables</command> user-land applications
you should now recompile and reinstall your kernel and modules, if you
hadn't done so before. For more information about installing the user-land
applications from source, check the <filename>INSTALL</filename> file in
the source which contains excellent information on the subject of
installation.
    </para>

   </section>

   <section id="installrh71">
    <title id="installrh71.title">Installation on Red Hat 7.1</title>
    <indexterm zone="installrh71">
      <primary>Basics</primary>
      <secondary>Installation on Red Hat 7.1</secondary>
    </indexterm>
 

    <para> Red Hat 7.1 comes preinstalled with a 2.4.x kernel that has
<systemitem>Netfilter</systemitem> and <command>iptables</command>
compiled in. It also contains all the basic user-land programs and
configuration files that are needed to run it. However, the Red Hat people
have disabled the whole thing by using the backward compatible
<command>ipchains</command> module. Annoying to say the least, and a lot
of people keep asking different mailing lists why
<command>iptables</command> doesn't work. So, let's take a brief look at how
to turn the ipchains module off and how to install
<command>iptables</command> instead.
    </para>

    <note>
     <para> The default Red Hat 7.1 installation today comes with a
hopelessly old version of the user-space applications, so you might want to
compile a new version of the applications as well as install a new and
custom compiled kernel before fully exploiting
<command>iptables</command>.
     </para>
    </note>

    <para>
First of all you will need to turn off the <command>ipchains</command> modules
so it won't start in the future. To do this, you will need to change some
filenames in the <filename>/etc/rc.d/</filename> directory-structure. The
following command should do it:
    </para>

    <indexterm zone="chkconfig">
      <primary>Chkconfig</primary>
    </indexterm>
 
    <para id="chkconfig">
     <command>chkconfig --level 0123456 ipchains off</command>
    </para>

    <para> By doing this we move all the soft links that points to the
<filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d/ipchains</filename> script to K92ipchains. The
first letter which per default would be S, tells the initscripts to start
the script. By changing this to K we tell it to Kill the service instead,
or to not run it if it was not previously started. Now the service won't
be started in the future.
    </para>

    <indexterm zone="ipchains">
      <primary>Ipchains</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para id="ipchains">
However, to stop the service from actually running right now we need to run 
another command. This is the <command>service</command> command which can be 
used to work on currently running services. We would then issue the following 
command to stop the <command>ipchains</command> service:
    </para>

    <para>
<command>service ipchains stop</command>
    </para>

    <para>
Finally, to start the <command>iptables</command> service. First of all, we
need to know which run-levels we want it to run in. Normally this would be in
run-level 2, 3 and 5. These run-levels are used for the following things:
    </para>

    <para>
     <itemizedlist mark="opencircle">
      <listitem>
       <para>
       2. Multiuser without NFS or the same as 3 if there is no networking.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
       3. Full multiuser mode, i.e. the normal run-level to run in.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
       5. X11. This is used if you automatically boot into Xwindows.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
To make <command>iptables</command> run in these run-levels we would do the
following commands:
    </para>

    <para>
<command>chkconfig --level 235 iptables on</command>
    </para>

The above commands would in other words make the <command>iptables</command>
service run in  run-level 2, 3 and 5. If you'd like the
<command>iptables</command> service to run in some other run-level you would
have to issue the same command in those. However, none of the other run-levels
should be used, so you should not really need to activate it for those
run-levels. Level 1 is for single user mode, i.e, when you need to fix a
screwedup box. Level 4 should be unused, and level 6 is for shutting the
computer down.
    </para>

    <para>
To activate the <command>iptables</command> service, we just run the following
command:
    </para>

    <para>
     <command>service iptables start</command>
    </para>

    <para> There are no rules in the <command>iptables</command> script.
To add rules to an Red Hat 7.1 box, there is two common ways. Firstly, you
could edit the <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d/iptables</filename> script. This
would have the undesired effect of deleting all the rules if you updated
the iptables package by RPM. The other way would be to load the rule-set
and then save it with the <command>iptables-save</command> command and
then have it loaded automatically by the rc.d scripts.
    </para>

    <para> First we will describe the how to set up
<command>iptables</command> by cutting and pasting to the
<command>iptables</command> init.d script. To add rules that are to be run
when the computer starts the service, you add them under the start)
section, or in the start() function. Note, if you add the rules under the
start) section don't forget to stop the start() function in the start)
section from running. Also, don't forget to edit a the stop) section
either which tells the script what to do when the computer is going down
for example, or when we are entering a run-level that doesn't require
<command>iptables</command>.  Also, don't forget to check out the restart
section and condrestart. Note that all this work will probably be trashed
if you have, for example, Red Hat Network automatically update your
packages. It may also be trashed by updating from the
<command>iptables</command> RPM package.
    </para>

    <para>
The second way of doing the set up would require the following: First of all,
make and write a rule-set in a shell script file, or directly with
<command>iptables</command>, that will meet your requirements, and don't
forget to experiment a bit. When you find a set up that works without
problems, or as you can see without bugs, use the
<command>iptables-save</command> command. You could either use it normally,
i.e. <command>iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables</command>, which would
save the rule-set to the file <filename>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</filename>.
This file is automatically used by the <command>iptables</command> rc.d script
to restore the rule-set in the future. The other way is to save the script by
doing <command>service iptables save</command>, which would save the script
automatically to <filename>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</filename>. The next time
you reboot the computer, the <command>iptables</command> rc.d script will use
the command <command>iptables-restore</command> to restore the rule-set from
the save-file <filename>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</filename>. Do not intermix
these two methods, since they may heavily damage each other and render your
firewall configuration useless.
    </para>

    <para>
When all of these steps are finished, you can deinstall the currently
installed <command>ipchains</command> and <command>iptables</command> packages.
This because we don't want the system to mix up the new
<command>iptables</command> user-land application with the old preinstalled
<command>iptables</command> applications. This step is only necessary if you
are going to install <command>iptables</command> from the source package. It's
not unusual for the new and the old package to get mixed up, since the rpm
based installation installs the package in non-standard places and won't get
overwritten by the installation for the new <command>iptables</command>
package. To carry out the deinstallation, do as follows:
    </para>

    <para>
<command>rpm -e iptables</command>
    </para>

    <para> And why keep <command>ipchains</command> lying around if you
won't be using it any more?  Removing it is done the same way as with the
old <command>iptables</command> binaries, etc:
    </para>

    <para>
<command>rpm -e ipchains</command>
    </para>

    <para> After all this has been completed, you will have finished with
the update of the <command>iptables</command> package from source, having
followed the source installation instructions. None of the old binaries,
libraries or include files etc should be lying around any more.

    <title>What's next?</title>

    <para>
This chapter has discussed how to get and how to install iptables and
netfilter on some common platforms. In most modern Linux distributions
iptables will come with the default installation, but sometimes it might be
necessary to compile your own kernel and iptables binaries to get the
absolutely latest updates. This chapter should have been a small help managing
this. 
    </para>

    <para>
The next chapter will discuss how tables and chains are traversed, and in
what order this happens and so forth. This is very important to comprehend to
be able to build your own working rulesets in the future. All the different
tables will be discussed in some depth also since they are created for
different purposes.
